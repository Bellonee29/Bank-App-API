💸 Instant Fund Transfers: Built robust and secure APIs for hassle-free money transfers, ensuring customers can send and receive funds with ease.

📝 Account Creation & Instant Account Generation: Implemented a streamlined account creation process with real-time account generation, offering customers the convenience of opening accounts anytime, anywhere.

🧾 Statement Generation & Email Delivery: Developed a feature that generates detailed account statements and automatically sends them to users via email, enhancing transparency and convenience.

📧 Transaction Notifications: Integrated a reliable mail service to send transaction notifications to customers, keeping them informed and secure about their financial activities.

⚙️ Leveraging Java, Spring Boot, and Postgres, we built a robust and scalable API that meets the highest standards of security and performance in the financial sector. Our commitment to innovation and excellence drove the success of this project, ensuring a seamless banking experience for our users.

💡 This project not only deepened my expertise in Java and Spring Boot but also taught me the intricacies of developing secure and reliable financial systems. I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of technology in the fintech industry.
